This project compares the performance of two popular machine learning models, Logistic Regression and Decision Tree, for predicting passenger survival on the Titanic dataset. 
The project involves building and evaluating both models to determine their accuracy and predictive power for this specific classification problem. 
The dataset includes features such as age, gender, and passenger class, which are used to predict survival outcomes. 
The repository contains Python scripts for each model, along with detailed comments and steps for data preprocessing, training, and evaluation.
